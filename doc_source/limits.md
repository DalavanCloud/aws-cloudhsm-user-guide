# AWS CloudHSM Limits<a name="limits"></a>

By default, the following limits apply to your AWS CloudHSM resources\. These limits apply per AWS Region and per AWS account\.

+ Clusters: 4

+ HSMs: 6

There is no limit on the number of HSMs per cluster, so you can distribute the HSMs across clusters any way you like\.

To request an increase to these limits, use the [service limit increase form](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-cloudhsm) in the AWS Support Center\.
