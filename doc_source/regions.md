# Regions<a name="regions"></a>

Visit [AWS Regions and Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cloudhsm_region) in the *AWS General Reference* or the [AWS Region Table](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) to see the regional availability for AWS CloudHSM\. 

Like most AWS resources, clusters and HSMs are used regionally\. To create an HSM in more than one region, you must first create a cluster in that region\. You cannot reuse or extend a cluster across regions\. You must perform all of the required steps listed in [Getting Started with AWS CloudHSM](getting-started.md) to create a new cluster in a new region\.
